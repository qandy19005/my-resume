    "cutobiography-content": "My name is Asa. I love self-study and learn some web technology and programming language. Ability to develop projects independently from database to front-end display, and use new technology on new project. I improve myself in every project, also finish the work in time. From writing native Javascript to using vue framework, npm and webpack. Writing css to sass and bootstrap. I even learned how to write unit test. I don’t know anything about back-end in the beginning, but I learned from my first project and also used PDO to call database and wrote APIs. Also able to setup website server. I think keep updating my web technology can solve more problems and get a sense of accomplishment from it. Teamwork is always better than developing alone for me. Because I can get other’s idea and share useful tools or technique. The most important thing is we can know each other when we work together."
