    "cutobiography-content": "My name is Asa. I am a self-motivated person, I love self-study, learn some web technology and programming language. Developed projects independently from database to front-end display, and use new technology on new project. I improve myself in every project, also finish the work in time. From writing native JavaScript to using vue framework, npm and webpack. As well as writing css to sass and bootstrap. I even learned how to write unit test. I don’t know anything about back-end in the beginning, but I learned from my first project and also used PDO to call database and wrote APIs. Also able to setup website server. It’s important to keep updating my web technology, it can solve more problems and get a sense of accomplishment from it. I enjoy teamwork program developing. In this way, we can get other’s idea and share useful tools or technique. The most important thing is we can know each other more when we work together.",
